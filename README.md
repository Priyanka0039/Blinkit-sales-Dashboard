4.Data Source
Blinkit's sales data comes from various internal systems that track customer orders, product inventory, and app or in-store transactions. It includes everything from what was bought and when, to how much was paid, whether there was a discount, and where the order was delivered. This raw data is cleaned up and organized into an easy-to-analyze format, grouping similar information like products, customers, and store locations. Once structured, it's loaded into a central database so Power BI can turn it into clear, interactive dashboards that help teams make smart, data-driven decisions.

5.Features and Highlights

Blinkit needed a way to quickly monitor and understand its complex sales data across multiple products, categories, and regions to identify trends, spot issues, and make faster, data-driven decisions. Without a centralized view, teams struggled with fragmented reports and delayed insights.

Goal of the Dashboard:
The dashboard aims to provide a single, real-time platform that consolidates sales performance metrics, allowing stakeholders to track revenue, product performance, customer behavior, and regional sales efficiently. This enables proactive decision-making to optimize operations and boost revenue.
